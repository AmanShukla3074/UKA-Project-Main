2. if user select movie -> api/movies/<int:pk>
        give availble show according to thaters -> /api/showtimes/?movie=<int:pk>
            showing seats availble in showtime -> /api/seats/?showtime=<int:showtime_id>/ **issue**
   if user select theater -> api/thater/<int:pk>
        give availble show according to movies -> /api/showtimes/?thater=<int:pk>
            showing seats availble in showtime -> /api/seats/?showtime=<int:showtime_id>/ 

3. after selecting seats in seat api
        data will post too Booking_M and Booking_Seat_M -> /api/bookings/ 
        *Payment Etc no knowledge*

// Filter Movies according to movie id
Certainly! If you opt for a flat API structure, where you have separate endpoints for movies and showtimes, you would typically filter the showtimes based on the movie's primary key. Below is an example implementation with models, serializers, views, and URLs:

### Models:

Assuming you have two models, one for movies and one for showtimes:

```python
# models.py
from django.db import models

class Movie(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()

class Showtime(models.Model):
    movie = models.ForeignKey(Movie, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    datetime = models.DateTimeField()
    theater = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```

### Serializers:

Create serializers for both models:

```python
# serializers.py
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Movie, Showtime

class MovieSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Movie
        fields = ['id', 'title', 'description']

class ShowtimeSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Showtime
        fields = ['id', 'datetime', 'theater']
```

### Views:

Create views to handle the API requests:

```python
# views.py
from rest_framework import generics
from .models import Movie, Showtime
from .serializers import MovieSerializer, ShowtimeSerializer

class MovieDetailAPIView(generics.RetrieveAPIView):
    queryset = Movie.objects.all()
    serializer_class = MovieSerializer

class ShowtimesListAPIView(generics.ListAPIView):
    serializer_class = ShowtimeSerializer

    def get_queryset(self):
        movie_id = self.kwargs['pk']
        return Showtime.objects.filter(movie_id=movie_id)
```

### URLs:

Configure the URL patterns:

```python
# urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import MovieDetailAPIView, ShowtimesListAPIView

urlpatterns = [
    path('movies/<int:pk>/', MovieDetailAPIView.as_view(), name='movie-detail'),
    path('showtimes/<int:pk>/', ShowtimesListAPIView.as_view(), name='showtimes-list'),
]
```

In this setup:

- The `MovieDetailAPIView` handles requests for movie details.
- The `ShowtimesListAPIView` handles requests for showtimes based on a movie's primary key (`<int:pk>`).

With these configurations, you can make requests to `/api/movies/<int:pk>/` to get movie details and `/api/showtimes/<int:pk>/` to get showtimes for a specific movie. The `ShowtimesListAPIView` uses the `get_queryset` method to filter showtimes based on the provided movie primary key.
