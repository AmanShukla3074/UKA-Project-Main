i am using reactJS and DRF so which APIs hitpoints i have to make?

Given that you are building a music streaming website using ReactJS for the frontend and Django Rest Framework (DRF) for the backend, you'll need to design APIs (hitpoints) that enable communication between the frontend and backend. Here are some key API endpoints you may need:

### Authentication Endpoints:
1. **User Registration:**
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/register/`
   - Purpose: Register a new user with their email, username, and password.

2. **User Login:**
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/login/`
   - Purpose: Authenticate a user by providing their login credentials.

3. **User Logout:**
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/logout/`
   - Purpose: Log out the currently authenticated user.

4. **User Profile:**
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/profile/`
   - Purpose: Retrieve the user's profile information after authentication.

### Music Catalog Endpoints:
5. **Get All Music:**
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/music/`
   - Purpose: Retrieve a list of all available songs in the catalog.

6. **Search Music:**
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/music/search/?query=<search_query>`
   - Purpose: Search for specific songs, artists, or albums based on the provided query.

7. **Get Genres:**
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/genres/`
   - Purpose: Retrieve a list of available music genres.

### Playlist Endpoints:
8. **Get User Playlists:**
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/playlists/`
   - Purpose: Retrieve a list of playlists created by the authenticated user.

9. **Create Playlist:**
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/playlists/`
   - Purpose: Create a new playlist for the authenticated user.

10. **Get Playlist Details:**
    - Endpoint: `GET /api/playlists/<playlist_id>/`
    - Purpose: Retrieve details of a specific playlist.

11. **Update Playlist:**
    - Endpoint: `PUT /api/playlists/<playlist_id>/`
    - Purpose: Update details of a specific playlist (e.g., name, description).

12. **Delete Playlist:**
    - Endpoint: `DELETE /api/playlists/<playlist_id>/`
    - Purpose: Delete a specific playlist.

13. **Add Song to Playlist:**
    - Endpoint: `POST /api/playlists/<playlist_id>/add-song/`
    - Purpose: Add a song to a specific playlist.

14. **Remove Song from Playlist:**
    - Endpoint: `POST /api/playlists/<playlist_id>/remove-song/`
    - Purpose: Remove a song from a specific playlist.

### Playback Endpoints:
15. **Play Song:**
    - Endpoint: `POST /api/playback/play/`
    - Purpose: Start playing a specific song.

16. **Pause Song:**
    - Endpoint: `POST /api/playback/pause/`
    - Purpose: Pause the currently playing song.

17. **Skip Song:**
    - Endpoint: `POST /api/playback/skip/`
    - Purpose: Skip to the next song in the playlist.

### Recommendations Endpoints:
18. **Get Recommended Songs:**
    - Endpoint: `GET /api/recommendations/`
    - Purpose: Retrieve a list of recommended songs based on the user's listening history.

These are just examples, and you may need to tailor them based on the specific features and requirements of your music streaming website. Additionally, consider implementing pagination for endpoints that return lists of items to improve performance. Ensure that your APIs are secure and follow best practices for authentication and authorization.










Quetions:
I already Have some requirements from DFDs and Modules. There are 3 Entites admin,artist and User.
admin can manage(add,remove and update) musics,albums and artists.
artist can upload music and albums and manage(add,remove and update) his uploaded albums and also view his analytics.
user can search musics,albums and artists.user can also manage(add,remove and update) his playlists and user will also have a special playlist "liked music" where user like a song song will automatically add to this playlist.
